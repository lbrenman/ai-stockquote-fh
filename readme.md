# Amplify Integration - Stock API

A stock quote and watch list API based on [**Finnhub**](https://finnhub.io/) created in Amplify Integration.

The project exposes two end points
* `GET /quote?symbol=AAPL`
* `GET /watchlist?symbols=AAPL,INTC,TXN,NVDA,AMZN,MSFT`

The `quote` API is basically a pass through of the Finnhub Stock quote API with a field mapped payload. It takes a single symbol as a query parameter. The `watchlist` API returns an array of stock quotes suitable for a watch list. It takes a comma separated list of symbols.

A sample Nodejs web app that uses the API's can be found [here](https://github.com/lbrenman/Stock-Nodejs-Web-app-to-Fusion-FH-Stock-api)

The project is intended to be a simple example of how to expose API endpoints and map and aggregate data in Amplify Integration using three method:
* HTTP Server - contractless
* HTTP Server - contractless using a common service
* API Server - using OAS Doc as starting point and leveraginG same common service

The OpenAPI 3.0 doc is provided in this repository as well
